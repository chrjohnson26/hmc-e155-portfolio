This is the first week of the Fall 2025 semester. I've just finished configuring the MicroPs quarto page. Here are a couple goals I have for myself this semester:

* Get better with hands on skills like soldering and making clean circuits
* Become confident with working with new hardware
* Proficency in reading data sheets and other documentation
